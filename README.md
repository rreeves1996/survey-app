# Survey App

Created by Ryan Reeves with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/).

## User Story

I am an individual looking to create surveys to gather and view specified amounts of data in an easy and intuitive way.

## T3 Stack

This app was created with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), which includes Next.js, NextAuth.js, TailwindCSS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, Daisy UI is used to make a sleek interface while also cutting down the sizes of class names significantly.
